To refer to a figure in an academic research paper, you should be clear and precise. Here are a few examples of how to do it correctly:

1. **When introducing a figure:**
   - "As shown in Figure 1, the results indicate a significant improvement in performance."
   - "Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of the proposed system."

2. **When discussing the content of a figure:**
   - "The trend observed in Figure 3 supports the hypothesis that increased training leads to better performance."
   - "Figure 4 presents the comparative analysis between the two algorithms."

3. **When referencing a figure from a previous section:**
   - "Refer to Figure 5 for a detailed view of the experimental setup."
   - "As depicted in Figure 6, the algorithm's accuracy increases with larger datasets."

In LaTeX, you would use the `\ref` command to ensure the figure number is updated automatically. Here's an example in LaTeX:

```latex
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:example}, the results indicate a significant improvement in performance.
```

Make sure each figure has a label defined when you include it, like this:

```latex
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{example.png}
\caption{Example of the proposed architecture}
\label{fig:example}
\end{figure}
```

By using the `\label{fig:example}` and `\ref{fig:example}` commands, you ensure that the figure is correctly referenced and numbered throughout your document.
